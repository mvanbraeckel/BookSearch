 * Searching Exercise
    1) Reads the data from BookList.txt into the program
        Write a class which represents a Book that contains:
            a) reference number (ID###)
            b) book title
        Create a new Book for each record in the datafile and adds it to an ArrayList
    2) Searches the ArrayList for the book with the given reference number (supplied by the user)
            If the reference number is found, display the title of that book,
            Otherwise display "Book # XX Not Found"
    3) Displays the number of Books the program had to examine before finding the desired book

    Your program is to:
        a) search for the book using both a linear and a binary search
        b) output the number of books that each search had to examine so that we may compare their efficiency

    NOTE: The total number of books is not known, therefore you should use ArrayLists.
